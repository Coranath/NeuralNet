# NeuralNet

## Goal

This is only meant to be an entry level neural network! I want to prove that I can, then later I'll expand it!

## Tools

As of now ONLY python with no libraries. I'd rather start small! I plan on using openCV to create and output the state of each tick, then compile those into a video of
the whole simulation! But first I need a functional neural net!

## Usage

Just pull clone it, and execute the one file. It will output what tick it's on so you can see progress. It also reports one agent's starting location before starting ticks, and his finishing location after all ticks.
