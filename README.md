# NeuralNet

## Goal

This is only meant to be an entry level neural network! I want to prove that I can, then later I'll expand it!

## Tools

As of now ONLY python with no libraries. I'd rather start small! I plan on using openCV to create and output the state of each tick, then compile those into a video of
the whole simulation! But first I need a functional neural net!
